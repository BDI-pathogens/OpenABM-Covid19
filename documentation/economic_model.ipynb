    "Accurate epidemiological simulations are a key tool for understanding, responding to and managing the Covid-19 pandemic. While understanding health-outcomes of policy interventions is rightly the primary focus of such simulations, there are clear benefits to a holistic simulation that takes into account economic dynamics as well. Created for this purpose, AdaptER-Covid19 (Adaptive Economic Response) is an economic simulation that integrates with the OpenABM-Covid19 simulator in order to jointly model health and economic outcomes of epidemics, with a particular focus on Covid-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaptER-Covid19 takes as input from the epidemiological part of the model timeseries describing the simulated course of the epidemic (e.g. number of symptomatic individuals) as well as exogenous variables (e.g. whether a lockdown is in place in the given scenario) and simulates the impact on key economic metrics such as GDP, corporate bankruptcy rate and individual insolvency rate, unemployment, household expenditure, private sector investment, opportunity gaps betweeen supply and demand per sector and behavioural changes caused by the epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that AdaptER-Covid19 is a simulator rather than a forecast. Its outputs are dependent on both the mathematical model as well as a host of parameter choices on which limited data is available (e.g. worker productivity by region and sector when limited to working from home) and which may vary considerably across scenarios. As such, simulation results from AdaptER-Covid19 may be used to draw qualitative conclusions when comparing different scenarios rather than for quantitative estimates or inference of absolute numbers. To allow the user to properly evaluate simulation results, we describe the current model in detail below."

    "The epidemic model produces detailed timeseries of the health impact on the population by region, age and economic sector that are then fed into the economic model at a daily frequency. Government interventions allow to change the trajectory of the epidemic and the economy. Some interventions, such as the imposition of a lockdown, have a direct effect on both the epidemic and the economic model, while other only affect one of the two models directly (e.g. the effect of furloughing on the economic model). Since the joint model runs daily, it is possible to simulate intervention policies that are responsive to events in the epidemic or the economy. Howeverm there is currently not direct feedback loop from the economic model back to the epidemic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic model is broken down into three main parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Input-Output Model, or simply GDP Model, links labour, capital and intermediate inoputs to production to the intermediate and final outputs, while taking interdependencies between sector of industry into account. In particular, it also determines the level of employment. The Input-Output Model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, solved using linear programming techniques.\n",
    "* The Corporate Bankruptcy Model is an agent-based model simulating corporate defaults. It is connected to the IO-Model through the net operating surplus of companies, the stock of capital available for production and the level of unemployment caused by corporate bankruptcies. \n",
    "* The Individual Insolvency Model takes household earnings and behaviour into account to determine aggregate levels of demand as well as the risk of households becoming insolvent. \n",
    "\n",
    "These components are complemented by a \"fear factor\" driving behavioural changes in household consumption and risk appetite of private sector investors, as well as an \"opportunity gap\" metric which measures the gap between supply and demand per sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some preliminary calibration of the model has been performed using public data sets for UK available from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, many further parameters require careful tuning to create accurate simulation results. In the codebase, we have *randomized* initial settings for these parameters, to make it easy to run the model. These parameters will need to be set by the user  depending on the application. See also the section on parameters below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into further detail on the component models, we point out key **limitations** in the current approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prices for goods and labour are assumed to be fixed. Inflation is not modelled.\n",
    "* In particular, unemployment is determined based on the assumptions that wages are fixed and workers cannot change industries. A full model of a competitive labour market would be a useful addition to the model.\n",
    "* Growth of capital in the economy is modelled through the agent-based corporate bankruptcy model as well as through a simplified model of investment by sector that combines long-term growth trends with opportunistic investment behaviour driven by risk appetite and the gap between supply and demand per sector. However, this is not a comprehensive model of the capital market. Also, the corporate bankruptcy model does currently not break down net operating surplus into interest payments and profits.\n",
    "* Imports and exports are part of the input-output model, however they are currently assumed to be fixed. Connecting these to a model of the global economy would be a straightforward extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to keep current limitations of the simulator in mind when interpreting results. See also the section on directions for future work below."

    "The foundation of our model of sectoral interdependencies is the European System of Accounts and in particular the supply and use tables and input-output analytical tables (IOATs) as set out by Eurostat [1] and applied to the UK by the ONS [2]. This framework allows to express total demand for a given product, on the one hand, as the sum of primary inputs and intermediate inputs to production at basic prices and, on the other hand, as the sum of intermediate demand and final uses. Primary inputs are, broadly, broken down into imports, taxes, compensation and operating surplus. Final uses are broken down into final consumption, capital formation and exports. This accounting perspective provides a common reference points that can be referred to across component models, from both a production and consumption perspective. In particular, the matrix of intermediate demand reflects sectoral interdependencies in the UK economy. Note that while IOATs typically categorize demand by product, we assume a categorization by sector, according to the UK's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC 2007), particularly A21 in NACE Rev. 2, see [2, Annex A].\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn this accounting framework into a model suitable for simulation, we need to specify a production function that, in particular, allows for substitution of one input to production with another, at a cost. Following [3], we adopt (a piecewise-linear approximation of) a Cobb-Douglas production function that takes intermediate inputs as well as imports, labour and (fixed) capital as arguments. The IOATs are used to calibrate weights in the Cobb-Douglas function. Here we make the crucial assumption that prices for goods are constant. The price of labour responds to exogenous changes to both quantity of labour and productivity imposed by illness or government measures such as lockdown, by region, sector and age-group. This is in contrast to the modelling of capital, where we assume that the stock of capital is fixed at a level given exogenously and the return on capital varies according to the model. Final use is capped at a level given exogenously. See also [4] for further background on modelling of network effects in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input-output model currently does not have an explicit representation of time. It takes as parameters the supply of labour, as derived from the output of the epidemiological model, and simulates the economic output as a fraction of pre-crisis GDP. (As mentioned above, other exogenous parameters such as demand and stock of capital can be used in future work.) The model is run repeatedly as parameter values change over time and the output is then integrated to estimate GDP over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is formulated as a linear optimization problem that is then solved using linear programming, in particular the `linprog` solver in `scipy`. Note that moving beyond our piecewise linear approximation of a Cobb-Douglas production function to the non-linear version, would require solving a non-linear optimization problem (NLP) instead. For this, the NLP solver in `scipy` is not sufficient. In future work, we recommend adopting `pyomo` to generate the NLP and then using `IPOPT` or a commercial solver for optimization."

    "The input-output model simulates economic output as a ratio of GDP at the start of the simulation. This ratio is then discounted based on corporate bankruptcies over time. Taken together, this produces a simulation of the shortfall in economic output due to the epidemic, at a short time horizon. By construction, it does not take growth dynamics into account. As a simple baseline model for economic growth we model the long-term GDP trend by assuming a fixed annual growth rate that persist throughout the simulation, except during lockdown periods. The level of economic output implied by this long term growth model is then multiplied by the discounted GDP ratio supplied by the shortfall model. Note that the shortfall model will dominate the results in the short term.\n",

On the one hand, the long-term growth model itself can be improved considerably, by adopting a more thorough autoregressive approach than assuming fixed growth. On the other hand, as mentioned above, a proper modelling of demand as part of the input-output model will provide more realistic long-term dynamics."

    "As indicated above, several directions for future enhancements of the model present themselves, apart from calibration and parameter tuning. First of all, there are a number of iterative enhancements to the model that will be of immediate benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tighter integration with spread model, in particular with regard to mapping of agent participation in networks in the spread model to worker states, number of key workers, etc. in the economic model.\n",
    "* Simulation scenarios that drive both the epidemic and the economic interventions in response to events in the simulation.\n",
    "* Improvement of runtime performance (i.e. increase of speed of execution and reduction of memory consumption). Only very limited effort has been spent so far on optimizing the implementation, and there are many areas that can be improved.\n",
    "* There is a wide range of economic variables that are already modelled, but that are currently simply assumed to be constant. Examples include imports and exports or government spending as a final use (source of demand). Exposing these variables to simulation scenarios and then using these to drive the simulation is a straightforeward extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going beyond these iterative improvements, there is also a range of major extensions of the model that would be worthwhile:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The input model currently uses a piecewise-linear production function. Switching the model to the (non-linear) Cobb-Douglas production function would model substitutability of inputs to production more realistically, as it would make small qunatities of substition more cost effective than in the current model, but large substitutions much more expensive. This would imply replacing the LP solver with an NLP solver, likely using a different solver library than Scipy (e.g. using Pyomo as a generic solver interface).\n",
    "* As mentioned in the section on limitations, the simulator currently uses simplified models of labour and capital markets. Replacing these with competitive equilibrium models of labour and captial markets would enhance model fidelity. \n",
    "* Switching to such competitive equilibrium models would also enable allowing prices to vary, leading to a simulation of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the long-run, an uplift of the data pipelines to incorporate granular and timely data and an automation of the calibration process would allow the model to update \"live\" in response to current events and simulate the effect of interventions in response to those events."
