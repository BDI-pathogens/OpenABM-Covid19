    "Accurate epidemiological simulations are a key tool for understanding, responding to and managing the Covid-19 pandemic. While understanding health-outcomes of policy interventions is rightly the primary focus of such simulations, there are clear benefits to a holistic simulation that takes into account economic dynamics as well. Created for this purpose, AdaptER-Covid19 (Adaptive Economic Response) is an economic simulation that integrates with the OpenABM-Covid19 simulator in order to jointly model health and economic outcomes of epidemics, with a particular focus on Covid-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaptER-Covid19 takes as input from the epidemiological part of the model timeseries describing the simulated course of the epidemic (e.g. number of symptomatic individuals) as well as exogenous variables (e.g. whether a lockdown is in place in the given scenario) and simulates the impact on key economic metrics such as GDP, corporate bankruptcy rate and individual insolvency rate. The main focus of the first version of the model is on the short-term effects of labour supply constraints on economic output, as well as second-order effects such as corporate bankruptcies and the longer-term effects these have on capital stock and employment. For this purpose, the UK economy is broken down by sector and region to model local and sector-specific effects of both the epidemic and the policy response. Demand-side effects, such as impact on consumption and investment are not modelled in detail; this will be addressed in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that AdaptER-Covid19 is a simulator rather than a forecast. Its outputs are dependent on both the mathematical model as well as a host of parameter choices on which limited data is available (e.g. worker productivity by region and sector when limited to working from home) and which may vary considerably across scenarios. As such, simulation results from AdaptER-Covid19 may be used to draw qualitative conclusions when comparing different scenarios rather than for quantitative estimates or inference of absolute numbers. To allow the user to properly evaluate simulation results, we describe the current model in detail below."

    "To limit complexity, the overall economic simulator is broken down into four linked components. The first three model the impact of the epidemic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an *input-output model* of the economy that links primary and intermediate inputs to production, on the one hand, to intermediate and final uses of production, on the other hand, on a sector by sector basis and is used in particular to model the effect of constraining labour supply on GDP,\n",
    "* a *corporate bankruptcy model* which estimates corporate default rates over time, based on data from the input-output model as well as assumptions around corporate cash flow,\n",
    "* an *individual solvency model* which estimates risk of individual insolvencies, by region and sector, based on both corporate bankruptcies as well as overall GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, the above three models constitute a simulation of the short-term shock to the economy caused by the epidemic. Moreover, the destruction of capital through an excess rate of corporate defaults is used to discount GDP going forward. However, this approach is inherently limited to modelling a shortfall of GDP with respect to a baseline and does not account for growth. For this purpose, we add\n",
    "\n",
    "* a *long-term trend model* which models growth dynamics of the economy based on fixed long-term growth assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "and which is overlaid on the combined output of the first three models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go into further detail on these four component models, we point out key **limitations** in the current approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some quantities that are already modelled in some of the component models are currently not fully linked with other components. For example, financial distress of households from the individual solvency model should be used to constrain household consumption in the final use section of the input-output model. Similarly, capital destruction given by the corporate bankruptcy model should directly affect capital stock in the primary input section of the input-output model. These feedback loops are currently modelled using ad-hoc GDP discounting. A deeper integration along the lines described above is future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consumption patterns are not represented in the model yet. Thus, there are a wide range of effects of economic import that are not currently possible to simulate, for example: Consumer reluctance to go to restaurants as case numbers increase, even if a lockdown is not in place. Pent-up demand leading to an increase in spending after a prolonged lockdown is lifted. Shift in demand towards delivery services and home entertainment. Increase in the savings rate across households in response to economic downturn.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, changes in investment behaviour of corporates are not simulated with granularity, apart from overall destruction of capital stock due to defaults. Effects that cannot be simulated in detail include: Investment in technology to facilitate working from home. Investment in delivery services and online ordering and divestment from brick-and-mortar stores. Deleveraging of corporates that do not default.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Government spending is not currently modelled as a separate source of demand, but rather assumed to be constant. In particular, specific economic stimulus packages are not taken into account and will be addressed in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As mentioned previously, the model currently combines a model of the short-to-medium term downside impact of the epidemic with a simple long-term growth trend model. Modelling the dynamics of demand as described above properly will give a more detailed simulation of the return to growth in the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The UK government has deployed a wide range of economic policies. Some of these, such as furloughing of workers and tax deferral are included to a first approximation. However, a wide range of other measures, from mortgage holidays and Statutory Sick Pay to the Covid-19 Corporate Financing Facility and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, are not currently modelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Labour and capital markets are not currently modelled. For example, the dynamics of employees switching firms or industries and of investors redeploying capital is not modelled. Prices for goods and services are assumed to be constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these limitations is left for future work. However, it is essential to keep current limitations of the simulator in mind when interpreting results. Also see the section on parameters below."

    "The foundation of our model of sectoral interdependencies is the European System of Accounts and in particular the supply and use tables and input-output analytical tables (IOATs) as set out by Eurostat [1] and applied to the UK by the ONS [2]. This framework allows to express total demand for a given product, on the one hand, as the sum of primary inputs and intermediate inputs to production at basic prices and, on the other hand, as the sum of intermediate demand and final uses. Primary inputs are, broadly, broken down into imports, taxes, compensation and operating surplus. Final uses are broken down into final consumption, capital formation and exports. This accounting perspective provides a common reference points that can be referred to across component models, from both a production and consumption perspective. In particular, the matrix of intermediate demand reflects sectoral interdependencies in the UK economy. Note that while IOATs typically categorize demand by product, we assume a categorization by sector, according to the UK's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC 2007), particularly A21 in NACE Rev. 2, see [2, Annex A].\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn this accounting framework into a model suitable for simulation, we need to specify a production function that, in particular, allows for substitution of one input to production with another, at a cost. Following [3], we adopt a Cobb-Douglas production function that takes intermediate inputs as well as imports, labour and (fixed) capital as arguments. The IOATs are used to calibrate weights in the Cobb-Douglas function. Here we make the crucial assumption that prices for goods are constant. The price of labour responds to exogenous changes to both quantity of labour and productivity imposed by illness or government measures such as lockdown, by region, sector and age-group. This is in contrast to the modelling of capital, where we assume that the stock of capital is fixed at a level given exogenously and the return on capital varies according to the model. Final use is capped at a level given exogenously. See also [4] for further background on modelling of network effects in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input-output model currently does not have an explicit representation of time. It takes as parameters the supply of labour, as derived from the output of the epidemiological model, and simulates the economic output as a fraction of pre-crisis GDP. (As mentioned above, other exogenous parameters such as demand and stock of capital can be used in future work.) The model is run repeatedly as parameter values change over time and the output is then integrated to estimate GDP over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code base currently contains a simplified version of the above model based on linear programming (LP) which scales economic output linearly for a given supply of labour by sector, region and age. A full nonlinear programming (NLP) implementation including the Cobb-Douglas production function is in development."

    "The objective of the bankruptcy model is to model the proportion of companies going insolvent and corresponding reduction to GDP  over time. In this context, it is crucial to distinguish between the probability of a specific company defaulting and the proportion of companies in the population that default. For this purpose we apply the log-logistic (Fisk) distribution to model the variation in number of days until companies go insolvent; this distribution is defined by two parameters (shape and scale) and is commonly used in survival analysis, including in the context of business survival [5,6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shape parameter of the distribution is assumed to be constant across sectors and consistent before, during, and after the epidemic. The scale parameter is modelled as a function of the mean operating surplus as well as the mean cash buffer that firms have in a given sector. Operating surplus is taken as given by the input-output model, with additional work underway to leverage the granular modelling of primary inputs available in the input-output model. The cash buffer is treated as exogenous parameter that needs to be calibrated. Care is taken to distinguish between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large corporations as the survival rates and GDP contributions are quite different for these groups of companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important limitation is that the model currently does not account for interest payments, which form a crucial fixed payment, especially for highly-leverages firms and will be addressed in future work. Another limitation, already mentioned above, is that government support programs are currently not modelled explicitly."

As a simple baseline model for economic growth we model the long-term GDP trend by assuming a fixed annual growth rate that persist throughout the simulation, except during lockdown periods.

    "A crucial question to consider is how the first two equations above can hold simultaneously, given that prices have been fixed and total factor productivity is taken as constant. Furthermore the relationship between $\\tilde{x}_{L,i}$ and $x_{L,i}$ is fixed and $o_i$ is taken to be constant. The only degree of freedom left is that in the production equation we use $x_{K,i}$ whereas in the accounting identity we use $\\tilde{x}_{K,i}$ and we do not impose any constraint on $p_K$. This means that any difference between the right-hand sides of the first two equations will be reflected in $\\frac{\\tilde{x}_{L,i}}{x_{L,i}}$ which is the return on capital. Again, compare Section 3.1, Definition, Item 2 in Fadinger et al."
