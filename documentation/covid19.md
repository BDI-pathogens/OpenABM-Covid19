OpenABM-Covid19: Agent-based model for modelling the Covid-19 
========================================================================

Description
-----------

OpenABM-Covid19 is an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the spread of Covid-19 in a city and to analyse the effect of both passive and active intervention strategies.
Interactions between individuals are modelled on networks representing households, work-places and random contacts.
The infection is transmitted between these contacts and the progression of the disease in individuals is modelled.
Instantaneous contract-tracing and quarantining of contacts is modelled allowing the
evaluation of the design and configuration of digital contract-tracing mobile phone apps.
