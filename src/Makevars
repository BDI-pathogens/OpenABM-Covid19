# macOS: Uncomment to find Homebrew non-standard installation path
#
# By default Homebrew installs files /usr/local, R searches that path when
# building packages. However, some users might need to install Homebrew files
# in a different location. Search for `brew` command and add flags if found.
# This must remain commented because it uses non-portable GNUmake extensions.
# Using these extensions cause `R CMD check` to raise warnings.
#
# BREW_PATH= $(shell which brew)
# ifeq (, $(BREW_PATH))
# 	BREW_LIBS=
# 	BREW_CFLAGS=
# else
# 	BREW_ROOT=$(abspath $(dir $(BREW_PATH))/..)
# 	BREW_LIBS=   -L$(BREW_ROOT)/lib
# 	BREW_CFLAGS= -I$(BREW_ROOT)/include
# endif


# Build flags for `R CMD INSTALL`
PKG_LIBS=   $(BREW_LIBS) -l:libgsl.a -l:libgslcblas.a -lm
