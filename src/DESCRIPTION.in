Description:
  OpenABM-Covid19 is an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the spread
  of Covid-19 in a city and to analyse the effect of both passive and active
  intervention strategies. Interactions between individuals are modelled on
  networks representing households, work-places and random contacts. The
  infection is transmitted between these contacts and the progression of the
  disease in individuals is modelled. Instantaneous contract-tracing and
  quarantining of contacts is modelled allowing the evaluation of the design and
  configuration of digital contract-tracing mobile phone apps.
