# Welcome to OpenABM-Covid19

OpenABM-Covid19 is an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the spread of Covid-19 in a city and to analyse the effect of both passive and active intervention strategies. Interactions between individuals are modelled on networks representing households, work-places and random contacts. The infection is transmitted between these contacts and the progression of the disease in individuals is modelled. Instantaneous contract-tracing and quarantining of contacts is modelled allowing the evaluation of the design and configuration of digital contract-tracing mobile phone apps.

Compilation and command line usage can be found in [the User's Guide](./users-guide/index.md). For those wishing to contribute to OpenABM-Covid19 you can read [the Developer's Guide](./dev-guide/index.md).

## History

OpenABM-Covid19 was developed by [the Pathogen Dynamics Group](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/research/fraser-pathogen-dynamics-group) 
at the University of Oxford in early 2020 to help simulate the spread of Covid-19 in the UK. 
It has since been extended and used by others, including
[the UK Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency)
to model different scenarios for the spread of disease.

## Maintenance

OpenABM-Covid19 is primarily maintained by [Dr Rob Hinch]() within the Fraser Group at 
[the Pandemic Sciences Instutite] at the University of Oxford. Contributions are welcome
from others. See [the Developer Guide](./dev-guide/index.md) if you are interested
in contributing.
